I add new file called FUBAR.md at the master branch and ask My team to clone it and create a new branch for each one of them.
Shadi and Raghad started be making some changing on there branch by typing names, and creating a new pull request after they pushed to thier branch when I try to make the merge I face the conflict that shadi and raghad edited at the same file and GitHub asked me to fix the conflict before the merge I did fix it and add a comment to it, Zaid pull the changes but it did not give him any error. 

### What I have learned
* In general what I have learned that each one of team need to work on seperated brranch so when any error happen it wont affect the master.
* I have learned how to fix conflict and assign teammate to review the code befoar the merge
